# Comprehensive Plan for Diabetes Treatment RAG Pipeline

## Objectives

1. Provide **tailored diabetes treatment recommendations** by combining insights from:
    - **Private Data**: Patient histories, demographics, and treatments.
    - **Public Data**: Up-to-date research, guidelines, and best practices.
2. Maintain **privacy compliance** by generalizing private data before public retrieval.
3. Deliver **clear, actionable recommendations** along with supporting context for transparency.

## Workflow Expectations

### Input

- **Private Data**: Structured patient information including:
    - **Critical Features**:
        - Symptoms: Severity and nature.
        - Co-morbidities: Conditions impacting treatment (e.g., kidney disease).
        - Demographics: Age, gender, ethnicity.
    - **Secondary Features**:
        - BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides.
    - **Contextual Features**:
        - Pregnancy status, lab metrics like GFR, HbA1c, fasting glucose.

### Query Preparation

1. **Private Query**:
    - Use all features from private data.
    - Aim: Retrieve similar patient cases and their treatments.
2. **Public Query**:
    - Generalize critical features (e.g., "A 30-year-old female with moderate thirst").
    - Aim: Fetch population-wide guidelines and research relevant to the patient's condition.

### Retrieval

1. **Private Data Retrieval**:
    - Query private FAISS database.
    - Retrieve cases of similar patients, treatments, and outcomes.
2. **Public Data Retrieval**:
    - Query public FAISS database.
    - Retrieve research papers, guidelines, and up-to-date treatments.

### Summarization

1. **Public Data**:
    - Consolidate public sources:
        - Focus on general treatments, population-specific insights, and new approaches.
2. **Private Data**:
    - Analyze retrieved patient cases:
        - Identify treatment paths, commonalities, and outcomes.
3. **Combined Summary**:
    - Integrate insights from both public and private summaries.
    - Provide a comprehensive view tailored to the patient.

### Recommendations

1. Combine insights from:
    - **Private Summary**: Patterns in similar patients’ treatments and outcomes.
    - **Public Summary**: Guidelines and best practices.
2. Deliver actionable, step-by-step recommendations addressing:
    - Patient-specific needs.
    - Population-wide best practices.
